# Docs Migration Tracker

## Execution Checklist

### Pre-Migration Tasks (Done)

**Template Design (Obsidian YAML v0):**

- [x] Define v0 template: `docs/_templates/spec.md`
- [x] Define v0 template: `docs/_templates/guide.md`
- [x] Define v0 template: `docs/_templates/decision.md`
- [x] Define v0 template: `work/_templates/initiative.md`
- [x] Define v0 template: `work/_templates/issue.md`

**Validator Updates:**

- [x] Add `yaml` dev dependency for proper YAML parsing
- [x] Rewrite `scripts/validate-docs-metadata.mjs` with new rules (dir→type match, required keys, enums, date format, uniqueness, field set separation)
- [x] Add required H2 heading validation per doc type (spec gated on `spec_state`)
- [x] Convert 9 already-migrated specs from Logseq `key::` to YAML frontmatter

**Specs & Structure:**

- [x] Create `docs/spec/development-lifecycle.md` and `docs/spec/docs-work-system.md`
- [x] Sort SPEC_INDEX by domain→state→id
- [x] Create `work/initiatives/` and `work/issues/` directories
- [x] Add `## Schema` and `## File Pointers` sections to spec template
- [x] Merge initiative Roadmap + Work Items into unified deliverable tables
- [x] Classify all legacy docs (this table)

### Next Steps

- [x] Agent scan: populate destination columns for all unmigrated docs
- [x] Proof-of-concept: migrate GRAPH_EXECUTION.md (split → spec + initiative)
- [ ] Strip roadmap content from `docs/spec/scheduler.md` → initiative
- [ ] Strip roadmap content from `docs/spec/rbac.md` → initiative
- [x] Update `docs/README.md` schema section to match new format

### Migration Process (per doc) — Exact Steps

> This is the battle-tested process used for 14+ successful AB+road migrations. Follow it exactly.

> **NO_DATA_LOSS** — The overriding invariant for every migration. Every sentence, table, code block, checklist item, and diagram in the source doc MUST appear in either the spec or the initiative (or both, for invariants). After each migration: diff the original against the combined output and account for every line. Deletions are only acceptable for formatting artifacts (blank lines, redundant headings) and genuinely obsolete content explicitly called out as such. When in doubt, keep it.

**Step 1: Read and classify.** Read the entire source doc. For each section, classify: as-built design (→ spec), procedural (→ guide), future/planned work (→ initiative), obsolete (→ archive).

**Step 2: `git mv` to spec directory.** `git mv docs/SOURCE.md docs/spec/target-name.md` — preserves git history. Do this BEFORE any edits.

**Step 3: Search existing initiatives.** There are 20+ initiatives in `work/initiatives/`. Always `ls work/initiatives/` and check for a topical match before creating a new one. When appending, add a clearly segmented track with `> Source: docs/ORIGINAL.md` attribution.

**Step 4: Route roadmap content to initiative FIRST.** This is the **MOST CRITICAL STEP**. Create or append to an initiative with ALL roadmap content (checklists, phase tables, file pointers for planned changes, future design sections). Use initiative template format: Crawl/Walk/Run deliverable tables. Include code snippets and interface definitions verbatim if they appear in roadmap sections. **Read the initiative back after writing to verify zero data loss.** Enforce NO_DATA_LOSS: every sentence from the source must appear ≥95% similar in either the spec or initiative. Minor formatting cleanup is allowed, but no paraphrasing, summarizing, or dropping content.

**Step 5: Surgically clean the spec.** Only AFTER roadmap content is safely in an initiative (NO_DATA_LOSS verified):

- Add YAML frontmatter (see `docs/_templates/spec.md`)
- Restructure into required headings: Context, Goal, Non-Goals, Core Invariants (SCREAMING_SNAKE IDs), Design (key decisions, architecture diagrams, schemas, file pointers for EXISTING code), Acceptance Checks, Open Questions, Related
- Remove: Implementation Checklists, P0/P1/P2 task lists, "Future Design" sections, file pointers for PLANNED changes
- Keep: ALL invariants, schemas, TypeScript interfaces, ASCII diagrams, design decisions, anti-patterns tables — these are spec-grade content
- Update internal cross-references (e.g., `TENANT_CONNECTIONS_SPEC.md` → `tenant-connections.md`)
- Add link to the initiative in Related section

**Step 6: Update SPEC_INDEX.** Add row to `docs/spec/SPEC_INDEX.md` alphabetically by ID. Remove from "Pending Migration" list if present.

**Step 7: Check AGENTS.md.** If root `AGENTS.md` has a pointer to the old `docs/SOURCE.md` location, update it to `docs/spec/target-name.md`.

**Step 8: Run `pnpm check:docs`.** HARD REQUIREMENT. Fix any errors before proceeding. Common issues: `estimate` max is 5, `spec_state` triggers H2 heading validation, initiative `state` enum is `Active|Paused|Done|Dropped`.

**Step 9: Update tracker.** Mark `[x]` in Done column. Update Ini column if destination differs from pre-planned.

**Step 10: Commit individually.** One commit per doc: `docs(migrate): target-name spec + roadmap to proj.name` or `docs(migrate): target-name spec + new proj.name`.

#### Content Placement Rules

| Content Type                                                            | Destination                                                        |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Invariants, rules, contracts                                            | Core Invariants (spec) AND Constraints (initiative)                |
| Architecture diagrams, schemas, TypeScript interfaces, design decisions | Design (spec)                                                      |
| Phase checklists, TODOs, implementation tasks                           | Roadmap tables (initiative)                                        |
| File pointers for existing code                                         | File Pointers under Design (spec)                                  |
| File pointers for planned changes                                       | Inside roadmap phase (initiative)                                  |
| "Future Design" / "Future Invariants" sections                          | Initiative (design notes or roadmap)                               |
| Known issues, resolved bugs                                             | Design Notes (initiative) or Known Issues (spec) if still relevant |
| Acceptance tests, verification commands                                 | Acceptance Checks (spec)                                           |
| Open questions about the spec itself (minor)                            | Open Questions (spec) — keep sparse                                |
| Planned work disguised as "Open Questions"                              | Route to initiative roadmap                                        |

### Post-Migration Tasks

- [x] All `Refs` checkboxes in migration table are checked (references updated)
- [ ] `.claude/commands/` updated to reference new doc/work locations and follow workflow conventions per `proj.development-workflows`
- [ ] Update SPEC_INDEX.md with each newly migrated spec
- [ ] Create redirect stubs at all original locations
- [ ] Verify `pnpm check:docs` passes after each batch

| `roadmap`    | Primarily future/planned work; becomes initiative              |
| `procedural` | Howto / setup steps; becomes guide                             |
| `snapshot`   | Point-in-time assessment; archive candidate                    |
| `obsolete`   | Superseded or historical; archive or delete                    |

## Migration Table

Destination columns: `filename.md` = planned output, `-` = not applicable.

Paths are relative to their type directory: Spec → `docs/spec/`, Ini → `work/initiatives/`, WI → `work/issues/`, Guide → `docs/guides/`.

## Summary

- **Total legacy docs**: ~100 (9 migrated, 91 remaining)
- **Spec destinations**: 55 (including 9 migrated)
- **Initiative destinations**: 30 (roadmap content extracted from specs)
- **Guide destinations**: 13
- **Obsolete / archive**: 15
- **Snapshot / no destination**: 8
- **WI column**: 0 (no docs produced standalone WIs — tasks tracked via initiatives)

## Agent Scan Flags

Content that doesn't cleanly fit the 4 types:

- **ARCHITECTURE_ENFORCEMENT_GAPS.md** — meta-snapshot of enforcement coverage; not a spec/guide/ini
- **CREDITS_PAGE_UI_CONSOLIDATION.md** — completed UI refactor plan; more postmortem than roadmap
- **DOCS_ORGANIZATION_PLAN.md** — superseded by `docs/spec/docs-work-system.md`; archive candidate
- **MVP_DELIVERABLES.md** — MVP scope snapshot (dated); planning artifact, not ongoing roadmap
- **REPO_STATE.md** — point-in-time repo assessment; archive candidate
- **LINTING_RULES.md** — rule inventory with Biome migration feasibility; reference snapshot
- **PAYMENTS_FRONTEND_DESIGN.md** / **PAYMENTS_TEST_DESIGN.md** — work is complete; obsolete
- **postmortems/**, **introspection/** — incident/review docs; snapshots, not guides
- **archive/PAYMENTS_WIDGET_DECISION.md** — ADR candidate (DePay vs Resmic decision)

## PR Checklist

- [ ] **Work Item:** wi.docs-migration-tracker
- [ ] **Spec:** docs/spec/spec-project-lifecycle.md#core-invariants
- [ ] **Invariants Validated:** SPEC_STATE_LIFECYCLE, INV-SPEC-SCOPE-001

## Validation

**Command:**

```bash
node scripts/validate-docs-metadata.mjs
```

**Expected:** All migrated docs pass validation.

## Notes

- **PIVOT**: Switched from Logseq `key::` to Obsidian YAML frontmatter (done)
- 9 already-migrated specs converted to YAML frontmatter (done, `pnpm check:docs` green)
- All migrated docs use `trust: draft` (upgrade later after review)
- Many legacy docs are conglomerates — ~30 produce both spec + initiative
- GRAPH_EXECUTION.md (1023 lines) is the highest-priority split candidate
- Proof-of-concept migration order: GRAPH_EXECUTION → then batch the clean single-type docs
- Several docs reclassified by agent scan (e.g., BUILD_ARCHITECTURE, CHECK_FULL, ENVIRONMENTS → spec not guide)
- RBAC + SCHEDULER already migrated but have roadmap content to extract into initiatives
- WI column is empty — no docs produced standalone work items; tasks are tracked via initiatives
