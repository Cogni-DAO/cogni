# GitOps Foundation — Manifests, IaC, and Argo CD Bootstrap

## Context

Today's deployment is a 950-line imperative `deploy.sh` that SSHs into bare metal VMs and runs Docker Compose. This works but lacks:

- **Rollback-by-revert** (currently must redeploy previous image manually)
- **Audit trail** (deploy history buried in CI logs, not git)
- **Self-healing** (relies on autoheal sidecar, not orchestrator-level)
- **Declarative promotion** (deploy = script execution, not manifest change)

The project plan (`proj.cicd-services-gitops` P1) already defines the target architecture:

```
cogni-template (app repo)     → Build + test + push images
    ↓ (image pushed)
infra/cd/ (manifests)      → Kustomize bases + overlays
    ↓ (Argo syncs)
k3s cluster (OpenTofu)        → Argo CD watches + applies
```

This task creates all the **files** needed. The actual provisioning and migration is task.0149.

## Design

### Outcome

A complete set of deployment manifests, IaC modules, and Argo CD configuration — validated locally with `kubectl kustomize` and `tofu plan` — ready to be applied when the k3s cluster is provisioned.

### Approach

**Solution**: Kustomize (built into kubectl, no extra tools) for manifest management. OpenTofu extending existing Cherry Servers provider for k3s VM provisioning. Argo CD for GitOps reconciliation. All pure infrastructure files under `infra/cd/` and `infra/`.

**Reuses**:

- Existing Cherry Servers OpenTofu provider (`infra/tofu/cherry/base/`)
- Existing cloud-init bootstrap pattern (`bootstrap.yaml`)
- Existing scheduler-worker service contract (health endpoints, env schema, image tagging)
- Existing GHCR image registry and tagging strategy (`{env}-{sha}-{service}`)

**Rejected alternatives**:

- **Helm**: More powerful but more complex. Kustomize's overlay model is simpler for our use case (same base, env-specific patches). No template language to debug. Built into kubectl.
- **Separate `cogni-deployments` repo**: Adds repo management overhead. Monorepo `infra/cd/` directory works for now — Argo CD can watch a subdirectory. Extract when the need arises (multiple teams, access control).
- **Full k8s (EKS/GKE)**: Overkill for pre-users. k3s gives us full K8s API on a single node with ~512MB RAM overhead. Same manifests work on full k8s later.
- **Pulumi/CDK**: TypeScript IaC is appealing but adds runtime dependency. OpenTofu is already established in the repo and battle-tested.
- **k3s on same VM as Docker Compose**: Messy coexistence. Dedicated VM keeps the transition clean and allows easy rollback.

### Migration Strategy

**Phase A (this task)**: Write all manifests and IaC files. Validate locally. No infrastructure changes.

**Phase B (task.0149)**: Provision k3s VM. Install Argo CD. Point at `infra/cd/`. Migrate scheduler-worker. Verify. Retire scheduler-worker from Compose.

**Phase C (future, P2)**: Migrate remaining services (app, litellm, temporal, postgres) to k3s. Retire Docker Compose entirely.

**Scheduler-worker goes first** because it's:

- Stateless (no volumes to migrate)
- Has health endpoints (`/livez`, `/readyz`)
- Has Zod-validated env (fail-fast on misconfiguration)
- Already digest-pinned in CI
- Lowest risk if migration fails (worker restarts don't affect users)

### Network Connectivity (Phase B)

During the transition period (scheduler-worker in k3s, everything else in Compose), the k3s pod needs to reach:

- **Temporal** (gRPC port 7233)
- **PostgreSQL** (port 5432)
- **App** (HTTP port 3000, for `APP_BASE_URL`)

**Approach**: Dedicated k3s VM on same Cherry Servers network. Services exposed via VM's internal IP. Selectorless Services + EndpointSlices in k3s point to the Compose VM's IP.

### Invariants

<!-- CODE REVIEW CRITERIA -->

- [ ] IMAGE_IMMUTABILITY: Kustomize images use `@sha256:` digests, never mutable tags (spec: proj.cicd-services-gitops)
- [ ] MANIFEST_DRIVEN_DEPLOY: Promotion = changing image digest in overlay, not rebuilding (spec: proj.cicd-services-gitops)
- [ ] ROLLBACK_BY_REVERT: Git revert on overlay restores previous digest (spec: proj.cicd-services-gitops)
- [ ] SERVICE_AS_PRODUCT: scheduler-worker manifest owns its own deployment + health config (spec: services-architecture-spec)
- [ ] HEALTH_ENDPOINTS_REQUIRED: K8s probes map to existing /livez (liveness) and /readyz (readiness) (spec: services-architecture-spec)
- [ ] NO_DOCKERFILE_HEALTHCHECK: Probes defined in K8s manifest, not Dockerfile (spec: services-architecture-spec)
- [ ] NO_SECRETS_IN_MANIFESTS: Secrets referenced via K8s Secret objects; SOPS/age encrypts at rest in repo (spec: proj.cicd-services-gitops)
- [ ] SIMPLE_SOLUTION: Kustomize (built-in) over Helm (template engine), k3s (lightweight) over full k8s
- [ ] ARCHITECTURE_ALIGNMENT: Extends existing OpenTofu + Cherry Servers pattern

### Files

**Deployment Manifests** (`infra/cd/`):

- Create: `infra/cd/AGENTS.md` — directory-level documentation
- Create: `infra/cd/base/scheduler-worker/kustomization.yaml` — Kustomize base resource list
- Create: `infra/cd/base/scheduler-worker/deployment.yaml` — K8s Deployment (replicas, probes, env, resources)
- Create: `infra/cd/base/scheduler-worker/service.yaml` — ClusterIP Service for health probes
- Create: `infra/cd/base/scheduler-worker/configmap.yaml` — Non-secret env vars (TEMPORAL_ADDRESS, etc.)
- Create: `infra/cd/base/scheduler-worker/external-services.yaml` — Selectorless Service + EndpointSlice for Compose VM connectivity (temporal, postgres, app)
- Create: `infra/cd/overlays/staging/kustomization.yaml` — Staging overlay (image digest, namespace, replicas, EndpointSlice IP patches)

**Secrets Strategy** (`infra/cd/secrets/`):

- Create: `infra/cd/secrets/README.md` — SOPS/age setup instructions, key management
- Create: `infra/cd/secrets/.sops.yaml` — SOPS configuration (age recipient, path rules)
- Create: `infra/cd/secrets/staging/scheduler-worker.enc.yaml` — Encrypted K8s Secret (SOPS-encrypted)
- Create: `infra/cd/secrets/production/scheduler-worker.enc.yaml` — Encrypted K8s Secret (SOPS-encrypted)

**OpenTofu k3s Module** (`infra/tofu/cherry/k3s/`):

- Create: `infra/tofu/cherry/k3s/main.tf` — VM resource + k3s cloud-init
- Create: `infra/tofu/cherry/k3s/variables.tf` — Input variables (extends base pattern)
- Create: `infra/tofu/cherry/k3s/outputs.tf` — VM IP + kubeconfig path
- Create: `infra/tofu/cherry/k3s/bootstrap-k3s.yaml` — Cloud-init: k3s install (Argo CD install step included in file but exercised in task.0149)

**Documentation**:

- Modify: `work/projects/proj.cicd-services-gitops.md` — Update P1 status, link work items

### Kustomize Base Design (scheduler-worker)

Derived from current `docker-compose.yml` + `services/scheduler-worker/src/bootstrap/env.ts` Zod schema:

**ConfigMap** (non-secret, env-specific values in overlays):

| Key                   | Base Value         | Overlay Override                                               |
| --------------------- | ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `TEMPORAL_ADDRESS`    | —                  | `temporal:7233` (selectorless Service, see below)              |
| `TEMPORAL_NAMESPACE`  | —                  | `cogni-production` / `cogni-staging`                           |
| `TEMPORAL_TASK_QUEUE` | `scheduler-tasks`  | —                                                              |
| `APP_BASE_URL`        | —                  | `http://app:3000` (selectorless Service)                       |
| `LOG_LEVEL`           | `info`             | —                                                              |
| `SERVICE_NAME`        | `scheduler-worker` | —                                                              |
| `HEALTH_PORT`         | `9000`             | —                                                              |
| `IMAGE_DIGEST`        | —                  | Set to image digest from overlay (used by `/version` endpoint) |
| `GH_REVIEW_APP_ID`    | —                  | Optional — GitHub App ID (not secret, public identifier)       |
| `GH_REPOS`            | —                  | Optional — comma-separated repos (not secret)                  |

**Secret** (SOPS-encrypted in repo, decrypted at apply time):

| Key                                | Source                                                           |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `DATABASE_URL`                     | Postgres DSN (service role, BYPASSRLS)                           |
| `SCHEDULER_API_TOKEN`              | min 32 chars, internal API auth                                  |
| `GH_REVIEW_APP_PRIVATE_KEY_BASE64` | Optional — GitHub App private key (only truly secret GitHub var) |

**Selectorless Service + EndpointSlice** (transition period — scheduler-worker in k3s, deps in Compose):

| K8s Service Name | Port | Target                 | Purpose           |
| ---------------- | ---- | ---------------------- | ----------------- |
| `temporal`       | 7233 | `<compose-vm-ip>:7233` | gRPC connectivity |
| `postgres`       | 5432 | `<compose-vm-ip>:5432` | DB connectivity   |
| `app`            | 3000 | `<compose-vm-ip>:3000` | HTTP connectivity |

> **R1: Why selectorless Service + EndpointSlice, not ExternalName or legacy Endpoints.** ExternalName returns a CNAME — DNS-only, can't remap ports. Legacy `kind: Endpoints` is deprecated in K8s v1.33+. Selectorless Service + EndpointSlice is the current K8s-documented pattern for services without pod selectors. Overlay patches the IP per environment.

```yaml
# Example: external-services.yaml (base)
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: temporal
spec:
  clusterIP: None
  ports:
    - port: 7233
      protocol: TCP
---
apiVersion: discovery.k8s.io/v1
kind: EndpointSlice
metadata:
  name: temporal-1
  labels:
    kubernetes.io/service-name: temporal
addressType: IPv4
endpoints:
  - addresses: ["10.0.0.1"] # placeholder — patched by overlay
ports:
  - port: 7233
    protocol: TCP
```

These let the scheduler-worker pod use the same hostnames (`temporal`, `app`) as in Compose. Replaced with real K8s Services when those workloads migrate to k3s.

**Deployment manifest:**

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: scheduler-worker
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: scheduler-worker
    app.kubernetes.io/part-of: cogni
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app.kubernetes.io/name: scheduler-worker
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: scheduler-worker

          ports:
            - containerPort: 9000
              name: health
          livenessProbe:
            httpGet:
              path: /livez
              port: health
            initialDelaySeconds: 10
            periodSeconds: 10
          readinessProbe:
            httpGet:
              path: /readyz
              port: health
            initialDelaySeconds: 5
            periodSeconds: 5
          envFrom:
            - configMapRef:
                name: scheduler-worker-config
            - secretRef:
                name: scheduler-worker-secrets
          resources:
            requests:
              memory: "128Mi"
              cpu: "100m"
            limits:
              memory: "512Mi"
              cpu: "500m"
```

### k3s Cloud-Init Design

Extends existing `bootstrap.yaml` pattern but installs k3s instead of Docker:

```yaml
# Key differences from base/bootstrap.yaml:
# 1. Installs k3s (includes containerd) instead of Docker
# 2. Configures k3s with --disable traefik (Caddy handles ingress)
# 3. Writes kubeconfig for remote kubectl access
# 4. Installs SOPS + age for secret decryption
# 5. Installs Argo CD via kubectl apply
```

k3s install is a single command: `curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | INSTALL_K3S_EXEC="--disable traefik --disable servicelb" sh -`

**GHCR private registry auth**: k3s reads `/etc/rancher/k3s/registries.yaml` at startup. Cloud-init writes this file with GHCR credentials (PAT token). This is simpler than per-Deployment `imagePullSecrets` for single-node — all pods get registry auth automatically.

```yaml
# /etc/rancher/k3s/registries.yaml
mirrors:
  ghcr.io:
    endpoint:
      - "https://ghcr.io"
configs:
  "ghcr.io":
    auth:
      username: cogni-deploy
      password: "${ghcr_deploy_token}" # from OpenTofu variable
```

### Argo CD Application Pattern

App-of-apps pattern: one root Application creates per-service Applications.

```yaml
# app-of-apps.yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: cogni-apps
  namespace: argocd
spec:
  project: default
  source:
    repoURL: https://github.com/cogni-dao/cogni-template.git
    path: infra/cd/argocd/applications
    targetRevision: staging # or main for production
  destination:
    server: https://kubernetes.default.svc
    namespace: argocd
  syncPolicy:
    automated:
      prune: true
      selfHeal: true
```

### SOPS/age Secret Strategy

- Generate one age keypair per environment (staging, production)
- Public key committed in `.sops.yaml` (safe — encryption only)
- Private key stored as K8s Secret in the cluster (manual, one-time)
- **ksops** as an Argo CD sidecar CMP (repo-server sidecar container with ksops binary + plugin.yaml). The legacy `configManagementPlugins` in argocd-cm was removed in Argo CD 2.8; sidecar model is the only supported path.
- Secrets encrypted at rest in git, decrypted at apply time
- `infra/cd/secrets/README.md` documents the full setup: key generation, cluster secret creation, ksops plugin config

### Promotion Flow (CI Integration — future, not this task)

```
CI pushes image → CI creates PR updating overlay digest →
  merge PR → Argo CD detects change → syncs to cluster
```

This task creates the manifests. CI integration (auto-PR on image push) is a follow-up.

### Design Review Notes

Findings from two rounds of `/review-design` applied to this design:

**R1 review:**

1. **R1 — Selectorless Service + EndpointSlice**: ExternalName does DNS-only (CNAME), can't remap ports. Legacy `kind: Endpoints` deprecated in K8s v1.33+. Using selectorless Service + EndpointSlice (current K8s-documented pattern). _(Applied above.)_
2. **R2 — ksops as sidecar CMP**: Legacy `configManagementPlugins` in argocd-cm removed in Argo CD 2.8. ksops runs as repo-server sidecar container. _(Applied above.)_
3. **R3 — Non-secret env vars moved to ConfigMap**: `GH_REVIEW_APP_ID` and `GH_REPOS` are not sensitive. Only `GH_REVIEW_APP_PRIVATE_KEY_BASE64` stays in Secret. _(Applied above.)_
4. **R4 — IMAGE_DIGEST added to ConfigMap**: Used by `/version` endpoint. Set in overlay to match the image digest. _(Applied above.)_
5. **R5 — Cloud-init scope clarified**: `bootstrap-k3s.yaml` includes Argo CD install commands but they're exercised in task.0149, not this task. _(Applied above.)_

**R2 review:** 6. **R6 — GHCR private registry auth**: k3s `registries.yaml` provides node-level auth for private GHCR. Simpler than per-Deployment `imagePullSecrets` for single-node. _(Applied above.)_ 7. **R7 — Non-HA Argo install labeled explicitly**: Non-HA is correct for single-node crawl; HA install is a P2 concern. _(Applied above.)_ 8. **R8 — Multi-service scope**: Directory structure and app-of-apps pattern designed for all services (scheduler-worker, app, litellm, temporal, postgres), not just scheduler-worker. Only scheduler-worker base is fully specified in this task. _(Applied above.)_

## Validation

**Automated:**

- `kubectl kustomize infra/cd/overlays/staging/` exits 0
- `kubectl kustomize infra/cd/overlays/production/` exits 0
- `tofu plan` in `infra/tofu/cherry/k3s/` succeeds (with mock vars)
- All YAML files are valid

**Manual:**

1. Review Kustomize output matches current docker-compose scheduler-worker env config
2. Review OpenTofu module extends cherry/base pattern correctly
3. Review Argo CD Applications point at correct paths
4. Review SOPS config has correct path rules
5. Review EndpointSlice addresses use placeholder IPs (replaced during task.0149)
