## Metadata

- **Owners:** @Cogni-DAO
- **Status:** draft

## Purpose

Shared Zod route contracts and HTTP router definitions for all node apps. PURE_LIBRARY — no env vars, no process lifecycle, no framework deps. Contains operation contracts (Zod input/output schemas), ts-rest HTTP router, and OpenAPI generation.

## Pointers

- [Packages Architecture](../../docs/spec/packages-architecture.md)
- [Architecture — Contracts Layer](../../docs/spec/architecture.md)

## Boundaries

```json
{
  "layer": "packages",
  "may_import": ["packages"],
  "must_not_import": [
    "app",
    "features",
    "ports",
    "core",
    "adapters",
    "shared",
    "services"
  ]
}
```

## Public Surface

All contract files re-exported via `src/index.ts`. Selective re-export for `ai.chat.v1.contract` to avoid `ChatMessage` name collision with `ai.completions.v1.contract`.

## Responsibilities

- This directory **does**: Define Zod schemas for API request/response shapes, HTTP router contracts, OpenAPI specs
- This directory **does not**: Make I/O calls, read env vars, contain business logic, define ports or adapters

## Dependencies

- **Internal:** `@cogni/ai-core`, `@cogni/aragon-osx`, `@cogni/node-core`
- **External:** `zod`, `@ts-rest/core`

## Notes

- Extracted from `apps/operator/src/contracts/` (task.0248 Phase 1)
- `ChatMessage` exported from `ai.completions.v1.contract` (OpenAI-compatible format); chat contract's `ChatMessage` excluded from barrel to avoid TS2308
