# Node Formation — DAO Setup Guide

> Source: docs/spec/node-formation.md

## When to Use This

You want to create a new Cogni DAO node. The formation wizard walks you through deploying a DAO + GovernanceERC20 token + CogniSignal contract on-chain, then verifying the deployment server-side.

## Preconditions

- [ ] Wallet connected via RainbowKit (configured in `src/shared/web3/wagmi.config.ts`)
- [ ] Connected to a supported chain: Base mainnet (8453) or Sepolia testnet (11155111)
- [ ] Sufficient ETH for gas (2 transactions)
- [ ] Dev server running (`pnpm dev` or `pnpm dev:stack`)

## Steps

### 1. Navigate to the Formation Wizard

Open `/setup/dao` in the application. The wizard page is at `src/app/(app)/setup/dao/page.tsx`.

### 2. Fill in Token Details (3 fields)

| Field           | Example             | Description                                  |
| --------------- | ------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `tokenName`     | "Cogni Governance"  | Human-readable name for the governance token |
| `tokenSymbol`   | "COGNI"             | Short ticker symbol                          |
| `initialHolder` | Your wallet address | Founder address — receives 1e18 tokens       |

### 3. Preflight Validation (Automatic)

The wizard runs preflight checks before enabling deployment:

1. `eth_getCode` for DAOFactory, PluginSetupProcessor, TokenVotingRepo
2. `DAOFactory.pluginSetupProcessor() == PSP` invariant check
3. Chain ID validated against `SUPPORTED_CHAIN_IDS`

If any check fails, the wizard shows an error and blocks deployment.

### 4. Sign Transaction 1: Create DAO

The wizard calls `DAOFactory.createDao()` with TokenVoting plugin and MintSettings. Your wallet signs the transaction. This deploys:

- DAO contract
- GovernanceERC20 token (mints 1e18 to `initialHolder`)
- TokenVoting plugin

### 5. Sign Transaction 2: Deploy CogniSignal

After TX 1 confirms, the wizard deploys `CogniSignal(daoAddress)`. The DAO address is derived client-side from the TX 1 receipt.

### 6. Server Verification (Automatic)

The wizard submits `{ chainId, daoTxHash, signalTxHash, initialHolder }` to the server endpoint (`POST /api/setup/verify`). The server:

1. Derives ALL addresses from transaction receipts (never trusts client)
2. Verifies `balanceOf(initialHolder) == 1e18`
3. Verifies `CogniSignal.DAO() == daoAddress`
4. Returns verified addresses + repo-spec YAML

### 7. Save Repo Spec

The returned `repoSpecYaml` should be saved to `.cogni/repo-spec.yaml` in your repository.

### 8. Deploy Infrastructure (Post-Formation)

After on-chain formation, the new node needs infrastructure to run. These steps are **not automated yet** — each is a manual TODO:

- [ ] **Add node overlay to deploy branches**: Create `infra/k8s/overlays/{env}/{node}/kustomization.yaml` on each `deploy/*` branch. `promote-and-deploy.yml` does not sync overlays from the app branch — deploy branches are the sole persistence layer for env-specific state. Copy an existing node's overlay and update `namePrefix`, `NodePort`, secret refs, and EndpointSlice IPs.
- [ ] **Add catalog entry**: Create `infra/catalog/{node}.yaml` on the app branch. Argo ApplicationSets discover nodes via catalog files — without this, Argo won't create an Application for the new node.
- [ ] **Create k8s secrets**: `{node}-node-app-secrets` in each target namespace. `deploy-infra.sh` creates these from GitHub environment secrets, but a new node needs its own DB and credentials.
- [ ] **Create node database**: Add the node's DB name to `COGNI_NODE_DBS` and run `db-provision`.
- [ ] **Update Caddy routing**: Add subdomain → NodePort mapping in `infra/compose/edge/configs/Caddyfile.tmpl`.
- [ ] **Update DNS**: Add A record for `{node}-{domain}` → VM IP.

See [Multi-Node Deploy Guide](./multi-node-deploy.md) for the full deployment workflow.

## Verification

After formation completes successfully:

1. Check that `.cogni/repo-spec.yaml` contains `dao_contract`, `plugin_contract`, `signal_contract`, and `chain_id` (as string)
2. Verify the DAO exists on the Aragon app for your chain
3. Confirm token balance: `balanceOf(initialHolder)` should return `1000000000000000000` (1e18)

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: Preflight fails with "Contract not found"

**Solution:** Ensure you're connected to a supported chain (Base mainnet or Sepolia). The Aragon OSx contracts are only deployed on these chains.

### Problem: Transaction reverts during createDao

**Solution:** Check that you have sufficient ETH for gas. The `createDao` call deploys multiple contracts and requires more gas than a simple transfer.

### Problem: Server verification returns error

**Solution:** The server uses strict receipt decoders — missing events cause errors. Ensure both transactions confirmed successfully on-chain before the verify call.
