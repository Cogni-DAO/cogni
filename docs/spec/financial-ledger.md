# Financial Ledger: Double-Entry Treasury with On-Chain Settlement

## Goal

All money I/O in one place. TigerBeetle is the transaction engine — every balance-changing event is a double-entry transfer enforced at the database level. Postgres stores metadata, workflow state, and reporting views. Blockchain is the external settlement rail. x402 is the edge payment protocol. The ledger records **economic events your app recognizes** — not raw blockchain events.

## Scope: Money-Movement Core

The ledger covers only operations that actually touch value. In the current system, that is 5-7 operations:

| Operation                               | Debit                             | Credit                         | Source                                |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| **User tops up credits (USDC deposit)** | Assets:OnChain:USDC               | Liability:UserCredits          | On-chain watcher confirms finality    |
| **AI spend burns credits**              | Liability:UserCredits             | Revenue:AIUsage                | charge_receipts (LiteLLM cost oracle) |
| **Operator wallet funded**              | Assets:Treasury:USDC              | Assets:OperatorFloat:USDC      | Splits distribution                   |
| **OpenRouter top-up**                   | Assets:OperatorFloat:USDC         | Expense:AI:OpenRouter          | Coinbase Commerce tx confirmed        |
| **Hosting expense (Cherry Servers)**    | Assets:Treasury:EUR               | Expense:Infrastructure:Hosting | API poll / invoice                    |
| **Epoch accrual (attribution)**         | Expense:ContributorRewards:Equity | Liability:UnclaimedEquity      | Finalized epoch statement             |
| **On-chain claim settled**              | Liability:UnclaimedEquity         | Assets:EmissionsVault:COGNI    | MerkleDistributor claim tx            |

Operations that do NOT touch value (attribution scoring, weight computation, identity resolution) do NOT go through the ledger.

## Core Invariants

| Rule                         | Constraint                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| DOUBLE_ENTRY_CANONICAL       | TigerBeetle enforces balanced double-entry at the engine level. Every transfer debits one account and credits another. Unbalanced transactions are structurally impossible.                                                                                  |
| TIGERBEETLE_IS_BALANCE_TRUTH | TigerBeetle account balances are the source of truth for all monetary state. Postgres balances (e.g., `billing_accounts.balance_credits`) become reconciliation checks, not authoritative.                                                                   |
| LEDGER_PORT_IS_WRITE_PATH    | All money-movement operations go through `FinancialLedgerPort`. No direct TigerBeetle writes from feature code.                                                                                                                                              |
| POSTGRES_IS_METADATA         | Postgres stores account names, descriptions, transfer explanations, workflow state, and reporting views. TigerBeetle stores balances and transfers. Linked via `user_data_128` fields.                                                                       |
| CHAIN_IS_SETTLEMENT          | Blockchain is the external settlement rail. TigerBeetle records the economic event when a chain transaction is confirmed. Do not mirror every raw blockchain event — record what the app recognizes (confirmed deposit, funded distributor, claimed tokens). |
| X402_AT_EDGE                 | x402 proves and settles external payments. TigerBeetle records how those payments change internal balances. The ledger works identically for prepaid credits and x402 per-request settlement.                                                                |
| ATTRIBUTION_NOT_FINANCIAL    | A signed attribution statement is a governance commitment (who earned what share), NOT a financial event. No money moves at epoch finalization. Optional accrual entry only.                                                                                 |
| FUNDING_IS_FINANCIAL         | Emissions funding of the MerkleDistributor IS a financial event.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| CLAIM_IS_FINANCIAL           | User on-chain claim from the distributor IS a financial event (liability reduction).                                                                                                                                                                         |
| OPERATOR_PORT_REQUIRED       | Treasury actions (fund distributor, rotate Merkle roots, contract management) require an Operator Port — a signing + policy boundary. NOT a custodial wallet.                                                                                                |
| ALL_MATH_BIGINT              | No floating point in monetary calculations. TigerBeetle uses u128 natively.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| MULTI_INSTRUMENT             | Separate TigerBeetle ledger IDs per asset type. Each is a first-class citizen with its own accounts.                                                                                                                                                         |
| SETTLEMENT_MANIFEST_REQUIRED | Every published distribution records a settlement manifest containing `epochId`, `statementHash`, `merkleRoot`, `totalAmount`, `fundingTxHash`, `publisher`, and `publishedAt`.                                                                              |
| TRUSTED_MVP_EXPLICIT         | MVP claim publication/funding is trusted governance execution (Safe/manual or equivalent), NOT on-chain emissions enforcement.                                                                                                                               |

### Ledger IDs (Asset Types)

| Ledger ID | Asset                     | Scale | Unit                        |
| --------- | ------------------------- | ----- | --------------------------- |
| 1         | USD                       | 2     | cents                       |
| 2         | USDC                      | 6     | micro-USDC                  |
| 3         | EUR                       | 2     | euro-cents                  |
| 100       | COGNI (governance token)  | 0     | whole tokens                |
| 200       | CREDIT (internal credits) | 0     | whole credits (10M per USD) |

### Two-Phase Transfers

TigerBeetle's pending → posted/voided pattern maps to:

- **x402 `upto` authorization** → pending transfer (reserve max amount)
- **x402 settlement** → post transfer (actual cost) or void (cancelled)
- **Attribution accrual** → pending transfer (governance commitment)
- **On-chain claim** → post transfer (tokens actually moved)
- **Operator top-up** → pending transfer (charge created) → post (tx confirmed)

## Accounts Hierarchy

```
; --- Ledger 200: CREDIT (internal AI credits, 10M per USD) ---
Assets:UserDeposits:CREDIT          ; Credits minted from USDC deposits
Liability:UserCredits:CREDIT        ; User credit balances (owed to users)
Revenue:AIUsage:CREDIT              ; Credits burned on AI usage
Revenue:x402Settlements:CREDIT      ; x402 per-request revenue (future)

; --- Ledger 2: USDC (on-chain stablecoin, scale=6) ---
Assets:OnChain:USDC                 ; Confirmed on-chain USDC deposits
Assets:Treasury:USDC                ; DAO treasury wallet
Assets:OperatorFloat:USDC           ; Operator wallet working balance
Expense:AI:OpenRouter:USDC          ; OpenRouter provider costs
Expense:ContributorRewards:USDC     ; USDC distributions (governance-voted, future)

; --- Ledger 100: COGNI (governance token, scale=0) ---
Assets:EmissionsVault:COGNI         ; Pre-minted tokens awaiting release
Assets:Distributor:COGNI            ; Tokens locked in MerkleDistributor
Liability:UnclaimedEquity:COGNI     ; Committed but unclaimed distributions
Expense:ContributorRewards:COGNI    ; Equity token distributions per epoch

; --- Ledger 3: EUR (fiat for hosting costs, scale=2) ---
Assets:Treasury:EUR                 ; EUR balance (for hosting payments)
Expense:Infrastructure:Hosting:EUR  ; Cherry Servers hosting costs
```

### Cross-Ledger Transfers (USDC → CREDIT)

TigerBeetle transfers operate within a single ledger. A USDC deposit that mints credits requires **two linked transfers** executed atomically:

```
Transfer 1 (ledger 2 / USDC, scale=6):
  debit:  Assets:OnChain:USDC
  credit: Clearing:USDCtoCredit:USDC
  amount: deposit_amount_micro_usdc

Transfer 2 (ledger 200 / CREDIT, scale=0):
  debit:  Clearing:USDCtoCredit:CREDIT
  credit: Liability:UserCredits:CREDIT
  amount: deposit_amount_micro_usdc * CREDITS_PER_USD / 1_000_000
```

Both transfers use TigerBeetle's `linked` flag — if either fails, both fail. The clearing accounts (`Clearing:USDCtoCredit:USDC` and `Clearing:USDCtoCredit:CREDIT`) exist solely to bridge ledgers. Their balances should net to zero over time (reconciliation check).

The conversion ratio uses the existing protocol constant: `CREDITS_PER_USD = 10_000_000`. Since USDC scale=6 (micro-USDC), the math is: `credits = micro_usdc * 10` (integer, no floats).

### Co-Write Failure Semantics

**Crawl**: All co-writes are non-blocking. Postgres write is the authoritative path. TigerBeetle write is fire-and-forget — on failure, log critical and continue. Reconciliation cron (separate concern) detects and alerts on Postgres/TB divergence. This means deposits succeed and AI responses are never blocked even if TigerBeetle is down.

**Walk**: Transactional guarantees added as TigerBeetle becomes the balance authority.

## Financial Events

**Real-time (per AI call):**

1. **AI spend**: User's credit balance debited, revenue credited. Triggered by `recordChargeReceipt()`.

**Per deposit:**

2. **USDC deposit confirmed**: On-chain watcher confirms finality → mint credits to user's account.

**Per operator cycle:**

3. **Splits distribution**: Operator share arrives in wallet → record float increase.
4. **OpenRouter top-up**: Operator wallet funds OpenRouter → record provider expense.

**Per epoch:**

5. **Epoch signed (optional accrual)**: Pending transfer: Expense:ContributorRewards:COGNI → Liability:UnclaimedEquity:COGNI.
6. **EmissionsVault funds distributor**: Post transfer: tokens move on-chain via Operator Port.
7. **User claims on-chain**: Liability reduction via MerkleDistributor claim tx.

**Periodic:**

8. **Cherry Servers invoice**: API poll → record hosting expense.

**x402 (forward path):**

9. **x402 inbound**: Facilitator settles → pending transfer → post with actual cost.

## Design

### FinancialLedgerPort Integration Points

The FinancialLedgerPort is called from these existing code paths:

| Existing code path                         | What changes                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `AccountService.recordChargeReceipt()`     | Also calls `FinancialLedgerPort.transfer()` for AI spend       |
| `AccountService.creditAccount()` (deposit) | Also calls `FinancialLedgerPort.transfer()` for credit mint    |
| Attribution `finalizeEpoch()`              | Also calls `FinancialLedgerPort.pendingTransfer()` for accrual |
| Operator wallet top-up (new)               | Calls `FinancialLedgerPort.transfer()` for OpenRouter expense  |
| Cherry Servers cron (new)                  | Calls `FinancialLedgerPort.transfer()` for hosting expense     |

The pattern is **co-write**: the existing Postgres operation continues to work, and a TigerBeetle transfer is recorded alongside it. TigerBeetle becomes the balance authority over time; Postgres balances become reconciliation checks.

### MVP Settlement Path

1. Attribution finalization produces a signed `AttributionStatement`.
2. Settlement resolves each finalized claimant to a wallet address.
3. `computeMerkleTree()` derives leaves from statement `credit_amount` entitlements.
4. The settlement token is the Aragon `GovernanceERC20` minted at node formation.
5. DAO-controlled trusted execution publishes a per-epoch Merkle root and funds the distributor.
6. Settlement publication stores a manifest linking `epochId`, `statementHash`, `merkleRoot`, `totalAmount`, `fundingTxHash`, `publisher`, and `publishedAt`.

### x402 Compatibility

The ledger architecture is designed to work identically for both billing models:

- **Prepaid credits (current)**: USDC deposit → TigerBeetle mint credits → spend burns credits
- **x402 per-request (forward)**: x402 `upto` → TigerBeetle pending transfer → post with actual cost → no credit balance needed

The x402 transition deletes `credit_ledger` and `billing_accounts.balance_credits` from Postgres. TigerBeetle's pending/posted transfers replace the DB-tracked credit balance natively.

## Enforcement Progression

| Phase     | What enforces the budget cap?                                                                                           | Source of truth for remaining supply                              |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Crawl** | Off-chain policy. Admin reviews. TigerBeetle balances provide real-time visibility.                                     | TigerBeetle `Assets:EmissionsVault:COGNI` balance                 |
| **Walk**  | Safe signers verify funding amount against policy before authorizing each release. TigerBeetle balance is the hard cap. | TigerBeetle + on-chain `emissionsHolder.balanceOf()` (must agree) |
| **Run**   | `EmissionsController` contract enforces caps via `require()`. TigerBeetle is reconciliation.                            | On-chain contract state                                           |

## Threat Model

| Threat                                           | MVP controls                                                                                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Signed statement exceeds budget policy           | Walk: Safe signers verify. Run: contract reverts. TigerBeetle balance provides real-time budget visibility in all phases. |
| Malicious maintainer changes settlement code     | Branch protection, required review, signed releases, reproducible artifacts.                                              |
| Compromised operator publishes wrong root/amount | Safe/manual policy, limited publisher set, manifest review.                                                               |
| Statement/root mismatch                          | Settlement manifest stores `statementHash`; root derived from signed statement.                                           |
| Replay/duplicate publication                     | One settlement record per epoch + explicit operator review.                                                               |
| Overfunding distributor                          | Funding amount = manifest `totalAmount`, reconciled against TigerBeetle balance.                                          |
| TigerBeetle/Postgres desync                      | Reconciliation cron compares TigerBeetle balances with Postgres state. Alert on divergence. TigerBeetle wins.             |

## Non-Goals

- Full GAAP reporting, tax, or accounting dimensions (Crawl)
- Decorating every operation magically — explicit FinancialLedgerPort calls from money-domain services
- Mirroring every raw blockchain event 1:1 — record economic events the app recognizes
- Building a "finance layer" — this is a money-movement core for 5-7 operations
- Beancount/hledger as runtime source of truth (export to plaintext accounting format for external audit if needed)
- Raw private key env vars (Operator Port uses keystore/Vault/CDP, never raw keys)
